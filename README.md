## Workflow Steps

### 1. Scheduled Trigger  
- The workflow runs daily at a specified time using a cron-based Schedule Trigger node.

### 2. Date Generator  
- Dynamically calculates today's date and a start date (e.g., 2-4 days earlier) to fetch recent news articles.

### 3. News Discovery  
- Sends a request to a news API (Tavily) using keywords related to drones and filters for trusted news domains.
- Retrieves article metadata such as titles, URLs, publication dates, and raw content.

### 4. Article Splitting & Image Search  
- Splits the list of articles into individual items.
- For each article, performs an image search fetching only valid images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png).

### 5. AI Summarization  
- Uses an AI language model (Groq Chat) to generate concise summaries (2-3 paragraphs), extract relevant hashtags, and identify trending keywords from the article content.

### 6. Content Formatting  
- Another AI agent formats the summary, hashtags, call-to-action, and hook line into a social mediaâ€“ready caption.
- Selects suitable image URLs from the provided list.

### 7. Parsing AI Output  
- Parses the AI-generated JSON content and selects the first valid image URL for posting.

### 8. Image Download  
- Downloads the selected image to prepare it for upload on LinkedIn.

### 9. Post to LinkedIn  
- Posts the formatted content and image on LinkedIn via API.
- Posts include:
  - Uppercase hook line
  - Summary paragraph
  - Hashtags spaced (no commas)
  - Call-to-action with article link
- Post visibility is set to public.

### 10. Logging  
- Post details like title, summary, URL, image link, publication date, and status are appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping.
